for this first we need to enter into the root directory using cd then our cwd that is current working directory will become the root one.next we will run the challenge/run but this time without the / in front because our cwd is / already

sameeksha03@DESKTOP-965QKSJ:~$  ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ challenge/run
Correct!!!
challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{UnD_8s9sKgbj2NVMWIm3rut_ccb.dlDN1QDL5MTM1czW}
