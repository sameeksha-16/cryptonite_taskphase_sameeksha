#matching with *
now we need to use '*' to navigate through cd to challenge in less than 4 characters. since we are already in our home directory we will use command cd /ch* to get into th echallenge directory and then run to get the flag

hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /ch*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{cJQRLxCDwl5pZXH8E_iUr-3Mh2m.dFjM4QDL5MTM1czW}




# matching with '?'
here the '?' can represent only a single character.

hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0IovPNlYhcdoWpW8eyJBWejfIay.dJjM4QDL5MTM1czW}
