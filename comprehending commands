# more catting practice
for this we couldn't change the directory using cd so what we did was cat then <absolute path>

You cannot use the 'cd' command in this level, and must retrieve the flag by
absolute path. Plus, I hid the flag in a different directory! You can find it
in the file /usr/share/mime/flag. Go cat it out **without** cding into that
directory!
