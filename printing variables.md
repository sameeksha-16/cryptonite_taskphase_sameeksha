# PRINTING VARIABLES
in this we use the echo command, till now we used the echo command to print values but it can also be used to print the value associated with the variables for this we need to use the '$' symbol .Here in this challenge we printed the value contained in variable flag.

```
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{8TR1tH9itUtogbfpieX_EwJuNDE.ddTN1QDL5MTM1czW}
```

# SETTING VARIABLES

Here we learnt how to input values or assign values into a variable. Like in all the other languages we use the '=' sign to assign values.But one thing that needs to be taken care of is that there should not be any spaces in between variable,value and the '=' sign or else it will try to run the variable name as a command .
Here we assign the value COLLEGE to the variable PWN.

```
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{AqabD1YfDRGFNB_TYOHnAj2iAGD.dlTN1QDL5MTM1czW}
  ```
